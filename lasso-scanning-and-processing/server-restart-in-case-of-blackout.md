# Server restart in case of blackout

First, just try to press the ON buttons of:

* NAS
* nusrv1
* nusrv9
* procsrv3

(procsrv3 is the only up upstairs, currently connected to mic3).

If they do not turn on, please check the multiplug (ciabatta).

### Restart multiplug (ciabatta)

* Disconnect the multiplug from the UPS (the cable going down from within the ciabatta, it is not any of the ciabatta plugs).
* Disconnect **all** not working plugs (from the same series):
* Reconnect the ciabatta to the UPS;
* Reconnect all the plugs one by one, check if power is back
